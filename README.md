in this repository you will find examples of less known features of svg, which is part of the html5 standard.

Besides offering nice graphics SVG also offers animation and a programming api.

Today SVG is well supported in all major browsers and can be used both inline and as stand alone objects in webpages.

You can combine the graphical power of SVG with regular browser features to create very nice applications.
